# Structural_Analysis_of_Shi-s_LW_WBC

This project is a code that conducted sturctural analysis study on the 'Light-weight White-box Cryptographic model' proposed in 2019.  
The paper was published in IEEE transaction on Computers as "A Light-Weight White-Box Encryption Scheme for Securing Distributed Embedded Devices" by Shi et al. (<u>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8675491</u>)  
Although LW-WBC(Light-Weight White-Box Cryptography) claims to be safe against various attack methods, we can obtain each component function through a structural analysis attack.  
Therefore, we implement the proposed LW-WBC based on the C language and obtain each component function through Python language.
